## About me

I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Purdue University. My research area is in computer systems and networking with a focus on synthesizing wide-area network designs with provable performance and designing resilient traffic engineering schemes. My works typically combine optimization-theoretic methods including modeling and proofs, along with system prototype building and evaluation which involves real world network topologies and data-sets, and implementation using Mininet and Open vSwitch. I also had experience in building large systems using languages including C++, Java and Python.  My advisor is [Professor Sanjay Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sanjay/).

I’m expecting to graduate in Spring 2022 and I’m currently looking for industry positions of software engineer or researcher starting from June 2022.
