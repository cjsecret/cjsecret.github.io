## About me

I'm a fifth year PhD student in Computer Engineering at Purdue University. My research area is in computer networks with a focus on designing networks with verifiable performance. I've also done work on reducing latency for mobile web applications. My advisor is [Professor Sanjay Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sanjay/).

## Education

* PhD student in Computer Engineering, Purdue University (2016 - present) 
* Bachelor in Computer Science, ACM Honored Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2012 - 2016)
